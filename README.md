functionality of each part of the code 

 

1. logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) 

A logger instance is created using the logging.getLogger(__name__) method. This logger will be used to log API call details. 

  

2. class APILoggingMiddleware 

   The APILoggingMiddleware class is defined, which is a custom Django middleware. 

   

3. Log and store API call details 

After processing the request and getting the response, the middleware checks if the user is authenticated (request.user.is_authenticated) and if the request path starts with /api/ (request.path.startswith(/api/)). This is to identify API calls. 

  

 If the conditions are met (authenticated user and API endpoint), the middleware logs the API call details and stores them in the database.It creates a new `APICall` object with relevant information such as the authenticated user, the requested API endpoint, the HTTP method, and the user's IP address.It saves the `APICall` object to the database.It logs the API call details using the logger created earlier. 

  

4. Retrieve and process API calls made by the user: 

The middleware retrieves all API calls made by the authenticated user (request.user) using the get_user_api_calls method.It iterates over the API calls and accesses the details of each API call (endpoint, method, and IP address).In the provided code, it prints the API call details, but you can replace this print statement with any specific processing or logging logic you need. 

  

5. def get_user_api_calls 

This method retrieves all API calls made by the specified user.It queries the APICall model to get all API calls associated with the user and returns the resulting queryset.

Representation of the workflow, illustrating how the request and response flow through the middleware and how the API call details are logged, stored, and processed. 

 

An incoming request is received by the Django application. 

The request passes through the APILoggingMiddleware. 

The middleware processes the request and obtains the response by calling the get_response function. 

If the user is authenticated and the request path starts with "/api/", the API call details are logged and stored in the database. 

The middleware retrieves all API calls made by the authenticated user from the database. 

The retrieved API calls are processed (in this case, they are printed). 

The response is returned to the client.
